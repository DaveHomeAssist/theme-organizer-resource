## Architecture Summary

```
main.js (orchestrator — state, input, UI routing, cutscene triggers)
├── data/     → immutable registries loaded at build time
├── game/     → turn-based engine (phase machine drives everything)
├── scene/    → Three.js visual layer (render-only, no game logic)
├── scoring/  → pure math (no side effects)
└── ui/       → DOM panels (receive state, return callbacks)
```

**Key design principle:** Game engine owns facts. Narrative layer owns presentation. Scene syncs to state each frame but never mutates it.

## Known Gaps for Expansion
- No free-roam player movement (grid-click only)
- NPCs are commentators, not quest-givers
- Turn-based only (no real-time option)
- No audio system
- No networking/multiplayer
- No skill tree or crafting
- Single garden plot (no world zones)
